h5. Importing SAP Dealers

Each month, do this:
* Email Kimm and ask for the report of dealers from SAP that she has sent in the past.
* Ensure the Excel report has columns in this order:
  :sold_to, :account_number, :name, :name2, :address, :city, :state, :zip, :telephone, :fax, :country, :del_flag, :del_block, :order_block, :empty_col, :email
* Export the Excel file as CSV with comma delimiters and quoted text
* Copy the CSV to: /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/sap_dealers.csv (on either rails server)
* log in to the server with ssh
* cd /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/current
* rake RAILS_ENV=production sap:import_dealers
* wait. it will take a while...
* verify data

h5. Things I need to work on...

================================================================
                 *** Notes for tomorrow ***

--> Toolkit idea: each brand should have:
  * hand-picked items to feature on its homepage: products, promos, etc.
  * Might need to uniquify toolkit resources by the filename in case two share 
  	the same item.
  * mass email dealers? Maybe, accounts have been created like so:
    - email addr on file, with "toolkit" password
  * get distributor accounts created
  * use the same logins for accommodation? dealer portal?

 Working on importing old registrations. The file we have seems
 odd. mostly digitech. check the old web server for older
 dbx registrations. find lexicon in the old database. ugh.
 
================================================================

=== TODO for Toolkits ===
* Verify user sign ups via SAP account number
* Dealers update their own info (address)
* Dealers update their own buy-it-now links
-- Created "DealerUsers" to link users to dealers--
-- Need some sort of separate sign-up with the acct. number and Phone number?--

* Dynamically choose homepage content, each brand start page

=== TODO for BSS site ===
* Finish migrating product content--SPECS, FAQs
  -> Dante products -- adjust image positions
  -> London option cards (current site has buttons that open PDFs)
* finish URL forwarders
* Design
* Individual contact forms?

=== TODO for dbx site ===
* Sales rep info

=== TODO for Lexicon ===
* (started) Software compatibility by version (Win XP, 7, etc.) and icons

_OMS Notes_
You can use this link: store.lexiconpro.com/addtocart.aspx?itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897&binlocid=7&qty=1

What you will need to change is: itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897 based on the product you want to link. You can get these ID's from the manage inventory page in the OMS backend. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

=== TODO for DigiTech ===
* Sound community Replacement!!!!!!!
* Load in old manuals from FTP site (XP series, etc.)

=== TODO (for all brands) ===
* Employee purchases--get IT to update links on myharman.com
* Clean up product info tabs methods (several in product.rb, product_helper.rb)
* Minitest for admin functions
* Separate admin permissions by brands
* Super-admin alerts:
  o When promos end
  o When buy-it-now problems are found
  o When reviews problems are found
* Optimization 
* Improve software page--is ugly, especially without release notes
* Redo layouts with a dynamic grid like zurb
* reduce duplication in css files by including snippets

=== Lower Priority ===
* Server load balancing
* ePedal category shelves
* -auto-pull news items from hpro feed-
* Salesforce FAQ integration
* Create Salesforce support cases
* Sitemaps using the sitemap plugin +news sitemaps
* Use themes_for_rails gem instead of custom hack, manage themes online
* Inline ecommerce with iLok integration for lexicon
* Remove dumb RSO site stuff, keep some of it for toolkits
