h1. Harman Signal Processing Websites

This rails application is a multi-site platform built to host the brand websites for Harman Signal Processing. Sites include: digitech.com, dod.com, lexiconpro.com, dbxpro.com, idx.harman.com, commercial.jbl.com, bssaudio.com, hardwirepedals.com, vocalistpro.com

Each site has an admin interface (/admin) and users authorized to admin various parts of the site.

h5. Importing SAP Dealers

Each month, do this:
* Email Kimm and ask for the report of dealers from SAP that she has sent in the past.
* Ensure the Excel report has columns in this order:
  :sold_to, :account_number, :name, :name2, :address, :city, :state, :zip, :telephone, :fax, :country, :del_flag, :del_block, :order_block, :empty_col, :email
* Export the Excel file as CSV with comma delimiters and quoted text
* Copy the CSV to: /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/sap_dealers.csv (on either rails server)
* log in to the server with ssh
* cd /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/current
* rake RAILS_ENV=production sap:import_dealers
* wait. it will take a while...
* verify data

h5. Then, import from BI which ties brands with dealers.

Each month, do this:
* Log in to BI, download the sales report for EACH brand for previous 12 months
* Export reports to Excel
* Open each in Excel on Windows (BI's format only seems to work on Win/Excel)
 - remove header block
 - save as CSV
* Copy each CSV to: /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/dod.csv, digitech.csv, etc.
 (make the file names match the friendly_id of each brand)
* rake RAILS_ENV=production sap:update_brand_dealers


h5. Things I need to work on...

================================================================
                 *** Notes for tomorrow ***

================================================================

=== TODO for Toolkits ===
* Dealers update their own info (address)
* Dealers update their own buy-it-now links
* Dynamically choose content for each brand start page

_other_
* Might need to uniquify toolkit resources by the filename in case two share 
  the same item.
* use the same logins for accommodation? dealer portal?

=== TODO for BSS site ===
* Don't worry about these until/unless someone asks:
  * FDS firmware update reg forms and URL forwarders 
  * Individual contact forms?

=== TODO for dbx site ===
* Sales rep info (would be easy now that it is in place for BSS)

=== TODO for Lexicon ===
* deliver download code for PCM plugins to PCM96 registrations
* (started) Software compatibility by version (Win XP, 7, etc.) and icons

_OMS Notes_
You can use this link: store.lexiconpro.com/addtocart.aspx?itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897&binlocid=7&qty=1

What you will need to change is: itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897 based on the product you want to link. You can get these ID's from the manage inventory page in the OMS backend. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

=== TODO for DigiTech ===
