Not how this file is supposed to be used. I'm keeping track of things
I need to work on...

================================================================
                 *** Notes for tomorrow ***

--> Toolkit idea: each brand should have:
  * intro text, with: latest info
  * hand-picked items to feature on its homepage: products, promos, etc.
  * left-hand marketing contacts (done, needs a mgmt interface)

 Working on importing old registrations. The file we have seems
 odd. mostly digitech. check the old web server for older
 dbx registrations. find lexicon in the old database. ugh.
 
================================================================

=== TODO for Toolkits ===
* Verify user sign ups via SAP account number--Jim Prins updating dealer SAP export
* Determine by acct. number which users access which brands
* Dealers update their own info (address)
* Dealers update their own buy-it-now links
-- Created "DealerUsers" to link users to dealers--
-- Need some sort of separate sign-up with the acct. number and Phone number?--

* Create Advertisements
* Create Logos
* Figure out where to store source files--Reid building server
* How to hide the NFS files to public URLs:

	marketing enters a path like this:
	  digitech/ads/whatever/else/filename.ai

	which we translate to an URL like this:
	  GET toolkit_resource/friendly_id

	The tk_download action checks that the user is logged in, then uses "send_file"
	with a local path like this:
	  Rails.root.join("../", "../", shared", "storage", @toolkit_resource.path)

	where the NFS share is mounted at /var/www/hmg/hsp_websites/shared/storage

* Add hi-res source files to: 
	Promotion#promotion_form
	         #tile
	         (what else?)
	ProductAttachment#product_attachment (product images)
	                 #product_media (videos, flash demos, etc)
	ProductDocument#document (manuals, etc.)
	SiteElement#resource

* Dynamically choose homepage content, each brand start page

=== TODO for BSS site ===
* Finish migrating product content--SPECS, FAQs
* Migrate news--done back thru 2009
* finish URL forwarders
* Design
* Re-do software overview page (organize by software instead of product)
* Individual contact forms?

=== TODO for dbx site ===
* Sales rep info

=== TODO for Lexicon ===
* (started) Software compatibility by version (Win XP, 7, etc.) and icons

_OMS Notes_
You can use this link: store.lexiconpro.com/addtocart.aspx?itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897&binlocid=7&qty=1

What you will need to change is: itemid=100170580&subitemid=358897 based on the product you want to link. You can get these ID's from the manage inventory page in the OMS backend. Please let me know if you have any questions.
