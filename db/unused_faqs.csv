However, you can assign your presets to the switches, but not the switches to the presets. To assign the presets to the switches, you would just use the copy feature in the previous Q & A.<br><br>For example, if you wanted to have the #1 switch call up the sound in preset #44, and your number #2 switch call up the sound in preset #82, you would copy preset 44 to the ""U01"" location, and copy preset #82 to the ""U02 location. Now when you are in the ""U-0"" bank, the number one switch will have the sound of 44 at the number 1 switch, and the sound of 82 at the number 2 switch. Although the display will not show the actual preset numbers of 44 or 82, the sounds will be the same because you have copied presets 44 and 82 to new locations."BP8,,"How do I restore one preset only, to its original form?","You will notice that when the BP8 factory, and user presets were exact duplicates of each other when the unit was first taken out of the box. In other words, presets ""U01"" through ""U94"" are exact copies of presets ""F01"" through ""F94"". So, to restore just one of your user presets to it's original form, just select the factory equivalent (F72 if you're trying to restore U72), and copy it to the user location."BP8,,How do I reset the entire BP8 to the factory programs?,"Note: this will erase and reset all programs to their original factory settings! To reinitialize the BP8, disconnect the power, press and hold the ""parameter up"" arrow while you reconnect the power. After about 2 seconds, release the parameter up button, and press the ""value up"" button once. This will reset the entire unit."BP8,,Does the BP8 bass processor have midi capability?,No. Control7,,Is the Control 7 only for Guitar Applications?,"Certainly not...while keyboard palyers enjoy the advantage of the sustain pedal (allowing them to do something *else* with their hands), their amy be times when using your feet would be better. One could change MIDI controllable lights, or even switch effects at the mixing console."Control7,,Can a Control 7 be used instead of a Control 1 with DigiTech Guitar Processors?,"Yes, but the response time won't be quite as quick as a Control 1 because of the Control 1's proprietary communication methods."ControlOne,,Can the Control One be used as a stand alone MIDI Control Pedal?,"No it cannot...although once it is connected to a DigiTech Device, it act as a very flexible MIDI Control Pedal in addition to controlling the Device directly."ControlOne,,Can I use a Control One with my Johnson Millennium?,Yes you can...it is completely compatible.ControlOne,,Can I use a Control One to control other products via MIDI if the Control One is connected to say a 2120?,"Yes...in a sense the 2120 (or some other DigiTech product) would be controlling the other product while the 2120 was being controlled by the Control One. Program Changes, CC On/Off values, and CC Expression Pedal values could be sent via MIDI to the other product you wish to control. Each DigiTech product may differ slightly in its programming to accomplish this...refer to the users manual for details."General Knowledge,,How long will the internal battery last? How do I know when it is time to change it? Where can I get a replacement battery?,"Most batteries will last around 5-6 years. If your processor starts to have a hard time remembering your user presets, then it is time to replace the battery.<br><br>Most Digitech products use a 3 volt lithium battery which can be obtained from most local electronics supply stores. This battery looks like a coin--or an oversized watch battery. Be sure to install the new battery with the positive (+) side touching the contact arm. Also, be sure the contact arm holds the battery firmly in place.<br><br>A handful of Digitech products (GSP21, DSP256, GFX-1, IPS33B) use a 4.5 volt battery which looks like a large AA battery. This battery is harder to find, but it can be ordered directly from Digitech by calling (801)566-8800."General Knowledge,,I have my effects processor plugged into the main input on my guitar amplifier. How come my sound has so much noise in it? I want to use the preamp in my guitar amp.,"Your Digitech processor is designed to be a preamp <i>and</i> an effects processor. Using the preamp in your guitar amplifier creates a conflict between the two preamps. Try connecting the main outputs on your processor to the effects return on your amp. This bypasses your amp's internal preamp and should clean up your sound.<br><br>If you want to use the preamp of your amp, connect your guitar directly into your amp. Use the effects loop of the amp to connect to your effects unit (send and return). Then turn off the preamp in the Digitech unit by editing the patch and bypassing all the preamp parameters."General Knowledge,,I can't hear a difference with the cabinet emulator turned on. How come?,"If you're playing through any kind of speaker, you won't hear a difference with the cabinet emulator turned on or off. This is because you're already playing through a speaker. The cabinet emulator is designed for use while sending the signal direct to a mixer, PA, or recording device."General Knowledge,,What about tubes? How long will they last? How do I know if it's time to replace them? What kind of tube should I use to replace them?,"If your processor has tubes, the life of your 12AX7 tube(s) can vary greatly depending on use. Generally they'll last anywhere from 2-4 years. You'll start to notice the quality of the tube distortion isn't quite the same as it used to be. That's when it's time to change the tube(s). Any 12AX7 tube will work fine. Once you've gotten into the inside of your unit, simply pull the tube out of its socket and plug in the new one. Be sure the pins line up properly on the socket before you firmly press the tube into place."General Knowledge,,What is a Passive Volume Pedal?,"The term ""passive"" refers to a pedal that does not require a battery and is capable of using no power to provide variable resistance.  An example of this type is Roland EV5.  This is more commonly refered to as an expression pedal or CV pedal.  This can only be used for volume if the pedal is designed for volume.  Most Volume pedals require the use of an internal battery, are not passive and cannot be used as an expression pedal.  ALL expression pedals that are ""passive"" and are CV type will provide the proper function."General Knowledge,,What is a phrase sampler?,A Phrase Sampler is a Delay effect that allows continuous regeration of a sampled audio input.

For example, to isolate Chorus, start on the program you want to modify.  Press the Edit button.  Now press the parameter arrows to the right until the LED on the top row is lit on the MOD/PITCH section.  Now use the same arrows to cursor down once.  The light on the left should be on the second one down.  If you follow this visually to the right you will notice that the cross section of these lights gives you MOD/PITCH and underneath is type.  The display should have the corresponding value for the type.  Now use the Value arrows to modify the type of MOD/PITCH until the display reads Chor (for Chorus).  Now you can use the Parameter arrows again to cursor down once to access the level parameter.  Pressing the Parameter down again will give you the amount and so on."StudioQuad/V2,,Can I upgrade a Studio Quad or Quad V2 to the Quad4 version?,The Quad4 features hardware improvements (new converters and larger delay RAM) which make the Quad4 software incompatible with the original Quad models.StudioQuad/V2,,"How do I use one program for input one, and another program for input two?","The Studio Quad series products cannot use more than one program at a time. In order to have separate effects on each of the different input/outputs, you must create one program that has a multiple effect configuration, and assign the effects for the inputs/outputs that you want."StudioQuad/V2,,How can I get several effects on each of the 4 inputs/outputs?,"The Studio Quad (and V2) can only run 4 effects at any given time. If you are using all four inputs to run discreet effects, you will only be able to have one effect on each input. If you are running 2 inputs, you can have 2 effects on each input, or three on one, and one on the other. The maximum number of effects in any program IS limited to 4."StudioQuad/V2,,How do I create a program with all four input/outputs running different effects?,"You must first start with a program that has the configuration that you need for the effects capability, and routing.
