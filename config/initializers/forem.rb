# Forem.user_class = "User"
# Forem.email_from_address = "support@digitech.com"
# Forem.user_profile_links = true

# If you want to change the layout that Forem uses, uncomment and customize these lines:
#
# Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
#   Forem::ApplicationController.layout "forem"
# end
#
# By default, these lines will use the layout located at app/views/layouts/forem.html.erb in your application.
