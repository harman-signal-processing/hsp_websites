<h4>What is the warranty period?</h4>

<p>This warranty protects you for a specific period (“Warranty Period”) from your
date of purchase as stated in your bill of sale or as otherwise established by
Harman. The specific Warranty Period applicable to this product varies for each
product type or model, and is determined in accordance with the Warranty Period
Table below.  If there is no Warranty Period expressly stated in the Warranty
Period Table below for any particular product that you have purchased, then, to
the fullest extent allowed by law, no warranty is provided for such product.
Any warranty service or parts replacement will not extend the Warranty Period.
Any warranty replacement parts or product will assume only the remainder of
Warranty Period of the original product.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated in the Warranty Period Table, if a product
is co-branded with two or more Harman Professional brands, the applicable Warranty
Period will be the one for the brand under which the entire product or product
system, as the case may be, is sold, and not for any of the individual component
products that make up the product or product system, as the case may be.</p>

<h4>What does this warranty cover, and what does it not cover?</h4>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, this warranty covers defects in
materials and workmanship if: (1) you purchased this product from a dealer that
is a Harman Professional authorized dealer with respect to this product at the
time of your purchase; (2) your original, dated bill of sale is presented whenever
warranty service is required during the warranty period; and (3) unless Harman
states otherwise, you purchased this product in brand new condition.</p>

<p>This policy does <strong>not</strong> cover damage or loss: caused by accident
(including force majeure or natural forces), misuse, abuse, neglect, product
modification; occurring during shipment (even when Harman has arranged or paid
for shipping); caused by failure to follow instructions in the owner’s guide,
including failure to perform recommended periodic or routine maintenance or
improper maintenance; resulting from repairs by someone Harman did not authorize;
(for products not specified by Harman for commercial or industrial use) caused by
any commercial or industrial use; to the decorative surface of this product; to
any data, software or information; caused by using this product for other than
its intended purpose; or covered under any of your (or your installer’s) insurance
policy or coverage. The following are <strong>also excluded</strong> from this
warranty: claims based upon any misrepresentations by the seller; if this
product’s serial number has been altered, defaced or removed; deterioration of
component parts, the nature of which is to become worn or depleted with use,
including batteries and headphone/headset ear pads/foam pads; any accessory to
this product, even if supplied by Harman; any installation, removal or
re-installation; any set-up calibration or adjustment; any performance variations
due to installation-related circumstances, such as program source quality or AC
power fluctuations.</p>

<p>Harman reserves the right to change the design of, or upgrade, any product
from time to time without notice and with no obligation to make any changes or
upgrades to any products previously sold or manufactured.</p>

<h4>What will Harman do to correct problems under warranty?</h4>

<p>If this product has a defect covered by this warranty, Harman will, at its sole
option, either: (1) repair this product at no charge to you, using new or
refurbished replacement parts, (2) exchange this product with a product that is
new or which has been manufactured from new or serviceable used parts and is at
least functionally equivalent to this product, or (3) refund the purchase price
of the product.</p>

<p>Any replaced or refunded parts or products shall become Harman property, and,
by submitting any product for warranty service, you represent and warrant to Harman
that you are the sole owner of such product, and that it is not subject to any
liens or encumbrances.</p>

<h4>Who is protected by the warranty?</h4>

<p>This warranty protects only the original end-user (“you”), and is not
transferrable. Any attempt to transfer this warranty shall immediately make this
warranty void.  This warranty is valid only for Harman Professional products, as
listed above, purchased from authorized Harman Professional dealers within the
fifty United States, and it does not apply to products purchased or transferred
elsewhere. If you purchased this product (or have subsequently transferred it)
outside the fifty United States, you should contact your local Harman distributor
for warranty information.</p>

<p>Customers outside the United States should contact your local Harman
distributor for warranty information.</p>

<p>You must be ready to provide detailed information on the symptoms or
difficulties you have observed with the product’s performance. We may direct you
to an authorized service center or ask you to send the product to us for repair.
In either case, you will have to present your original bill of sale to establish
warranty coverage. Do not send this product to us without prior authorization and
a corresponding return authorization number. Warranty repair of this product must
be done by an authorized dealer or service center. To the fullest extent allowed
by law, unauthorized warranty repair will void the warranty and is done at your
risk.</p>

<p>You are responsible for transporting your product to (as well as from, in the
event that Harman finds no defect covered by this warranty) either Harman or an
authorized service center and for payment of all shipping charges; however, Harman
will pay the return shipping charges (in the event you return the product to
Harman) if the repairs are covered by warranty, provided that, Harman reserves
the right to choose the mode, the carrier and the timing of such return shipping
(if Harman finds that there are no defects covered by this warranty, then you
shall be responsible for all shipping charges). If you experience difficulty in
transporting your product or are in need of packing materials, please advise us
and we may be able (but have no obligation) to suggest alternative procedures
and/or provide adequate packing materials.</p>

<p>In the event Harman is unable to return the product to you because you have
provided incorrect or insufficient contact information, or when you fail to
arrange for the pick-up or retrieval of the product when you are obligated to
arrange or pay for shipping the product back to you, Harman reserves the right,
without notice to you, to charge you storage and handling costs for the entire
duration that Harman has possession of your product, and, to the fullest extent
allowed by law, to sell or dispose of your product to defray such costs. You
hereby authorize Harman to charge those costs against any credit or debit card
or other electronic payment account you have provided to us for any reason.</p>

<p>THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. HARMAN SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. IF HARMAN CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER THIS LIMITED
WARRANTY, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS
WARRANTY.</p>

<p>No Harman reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification,
extension, or addition to this warranty.</p>

<p>HARMAN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONDITION, OR
UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS,
DOWNTIME, GOODWILL, DAMAGE TO OR REPLACEMENT OF ANY EQUIPMENT OR PROPERTY, ANY
COSTS OF RECOVERING, REPROGRAMMING, OR REPRODUCING ANY PROGRAM OR DATA STORED IN
OR USED WITH HARMAN PRODUCTS. HARMAN’S TOTAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE
REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THIS PRODUCT OR TO THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE PURSUANT
TO THE TERMS OF THIS WARRANTY.</p>

<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE
OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY BY STATE OR (WHERE APPLICABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE
HARMAN HAS NON-US/CANADIAN AUTHORIZED DEALERS) COUNTRY. NO ACTION OR CLAIM TO
ENFORCE THIS WARRANTY SHALL BE COMMENCED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE WARRANTY
PERIOD.</p>

<p>In the event that there is a difference between this warranty and the
provisions in any owner’s manuals, warranty leaflets, or packaging cartons,
the terms of this warranty will prevail to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>
