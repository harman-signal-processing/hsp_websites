    <p>The locales here are available for translation everywhere on the platform. This allows us to
      launch individual product and product family pages in multiple languages without launching an
      entire site in that language.</p>
    <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Editing/creating locale codes requires a restart of the application
      on all servers. This is because the locale codes are read when generating URLs (which happens
      as the application starts). Do not edit/create locale codes unless you can immediately restart
      the application.</p>
    <p><em>Why doesn't a particular locale appear in the top nav of the site?</em> Typically we don't
      place a locale in the top-nav until it has gone through a full translation. This includes
      translating the YAML file and most of the product/product family content. Once that is done,
      <%= link_to [:admin, website.brand] do %> edit the <%= website.brand.name %> websites<% end %>
      and add the locale to each one. Mark it as "complete" to make it appear in the top nav.</p>
    <p>If you add a locale to a website without making it "complete", then it will be available
      as an option for products and product families to be included or excluded from that locale.</p>
    <p>Confused? Me too.</p>
